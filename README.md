## MOODIFY
Created with create-react-app and completed using JavaScript, CSS, and React. 

Client Live Deployment: https://vercel.com/mf-ff99/moodify

Moodify allows registered users to log in to their account and create an in-depth database of their 
moods over time. A comprehensive chart is provided to map out your mood over time. A recent addition
to the application is the ability to log the user's hours slept and track their sleep in tandem with 
their mood.

I created both the fronted and backend on my own. The backend is running on Node.js and PostgreSQL.
