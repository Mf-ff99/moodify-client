## MOODIFY
Created with create-react-app and completed using JavaScript, CSS, and React. 

Client Live Deployment: https://vercel.com/mf-ff99/moodify

Moodify allows registered users to log in to their account and create an in-depth database of their 
moods over time. 

A ladning page greets the user, as displayed below.

The user can either register a new account, or log in with a demo account to view the application's functionality.

On the home page, the chart is front and center with a history of your moods shown on the right-hand side.
A comprehensive chart is provided to map out the user's mood over time. A recent addition
to the application is the ability to log the user's hours slept and track their sleep in tandem with 
their mood, represented by the purple line on the y-axis.

A filter is available to filter your record by all time, past month, and past week.
